== Setting up

*Prerequisites*

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

*Importing the project into IntelliJ*

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9.
.. Click `OK`.
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the project directory and click `OK`
. Select `Create project from existing sources` and click `Next`
. Rename the project if you want. Click `Next`
. Ensure that your `\src` and `\test\java` folders are checked. Keep clicking `Next`
. Click `Finish`
. Try running the application (right-click the `Main` class under the `src` folder, and click `Run 'Main.main()'`)
. Observe how the application fails to compile. This is because the `JAXB` APIs is no longer contained under the default classpath from Java 9 onwards. To fix this issue, the `JAXB` module needs to be added to the classpath:
.. Open any of the files which has the compilation error (e.g `StorageFile.java`), and place your cursor over any `javax.xml.bind` in the imports highlighted in red
.. Press ALT+ENTER and select `--add-modules=java.xml.bind to module compiler options`
.. Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations...`
.. Under `Configuration`, add `--add-modules java.xml.bind` into `VM options`
. Run the application again to ensure it compiles and runs without any errors
. Add JUnit 4 to classpath
.. Open any test file in `\test\java` and place your cursor over any `@Test` highlighted in red
.. Press ALT+ENTER and select `Add 'JUnit4' to classpath`
.. Select `Use 'JUnit4' from IntelliJ IDEA distribution` and click `OK`
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`)
. Observe how some tests fail. That is because they try to access the test data from the wrong directory (the working directory is expected to be the root directory, but IntelliJ runs the test with `test\` as the working directory by default). Some test classes also uses `JAXB` APIs. To fix these issues:
.. Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations...`
.. On the list at the left, expand `JUnit`, and remove all the test configurations (e.g. `All in test`) by selecting it and clicking on the '-' icon at the top of the list
.. Expand `Defaults`, and ensure that `JUnit` is selected
.. Under `Configuration`, change the `Working directory` to the `addressbook-level2` folder, and add `--add-modules java.xml.bind` into `VM options` 
.. Click `OK`
. Run the tests again to ensure they all pass now.

== Testing

=== I/O tests

*Windows*

. Open a DOS window in the `test` folder
. Run the `runtests.bat` script
. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`,
the test has passed.

*Mac/Unix/Linux*

. Open a terminal window in the `test` folder
. Run the `runtests.sh` script
. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`,
the test has passed.

=== JUnit tests

* In IntelliJ, right-click on the `test` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`

=== Troubleshooting test failures

* Problem: How do I examine the exact differences between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`? +
Solution: You can use a diff/merge tool with a GUI e.g. WinMerge (on Windows)

* Problem: The two files look exactly the same, but the test script reports they are different. +
Solution: This can happen because the line endings used by Windows is different from Unix-based
OSes. Convert the actual.txt to the format used by your OS using some https://kb.iu.edu/d/acux[utility].

* Problem: Test fails during the very first time. +
Solution: The output of the very first test run could be slightly different because the program
creates a new storage file. Tests should pass from the 2nd run onwards.
